# Data_Structures
Here are my attempts at explaining the theory behind advanced data structures. I will also commit optimized existing STL data structures for competitive programming (I call them Homemade structures). The Benchmarker header file will be a common occrance throughout this process to compare the performance of Homemade and STL.

Hope you find this useful!
